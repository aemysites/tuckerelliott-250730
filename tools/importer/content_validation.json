Over the past year, we\u2019ve connected with tens of thousands of partners and customers in 20 cities worldwide. But it\u2019s especially meaningful to be in New York\u2014where MongoDB was founded and where we are still headquartered. This post is also available in: Deutsch , Fran\u00e7ais , Espa\u00f1ol , Portugu\u00eas , Italiano , \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 , \u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587 . During the event, we introduced new capabilities that advance MongoDB\u2019s position as the world\u2019s leading modern database. With MongoDB 8.2, our most feature-rich and performant release yet, we are raising the bar for what developers can achieve. We also shared more about our Voyage AI embedding models and rerankers, which bring state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency to building trustworthy, reliable AI applications. And with Search and Vector Search now in public preview for both MongoDB Community Edition and Enterprise Server , we are putting powerful retrieval capabilities directly into customers\u2019 environments\u2014wherever they prefer to run. I am particularly excited about the launch of the MongoDB Application Modernization Platform , or AMP. Enterprises everywhere are grappling with the massive costs of legacy systems that cannot support the demands of AI. AMP is not a simple \u201clift-and-shift.\u201d It is a repeatable, end-to-end platform that combines AI-powered tooling, proven techniques, and specialized talent to reinvent critical business systems while minimizing cost and risk. Early results are impressive: enterprises moving from old systems to MongoDB are doing so two to three times faster, and tasks like code rewriting are accelerating by an order of magnitude. Figure 1. MongoDB.local NYC keynote. Watch the full keynote on YouTube. Becoming the world\u2019s most popular modern database When I reflect on MongoDB\u2019s journey, I\u2019m struck by how far we\u2019ve come. When I joined just over a decade ago, we had only a few thousand customers. Today, MongoDB serves nearly 60,000 organizations across every industry and vertical, including more than 70% of the Fortune 500 and cutting-edge AI-native startups. Yet the reason behind our growth remains the same. Relational databases built in the 1970s were never designed for the scale and complexity of modern applications. They were rigid, hard to scale, and slow to adapt. Our founders, who had lived those limitations first-hand while building DoubleClick, set out to create something better: a database model designed for the realities of the modern world. The document model was born. Based in JSON, the document model is intuitive, flexible, and powerful. It allows developers to represent complex, interdependent, and constantly changing data in a natural way. And, as we enter the era of AI, those same qualities\u2014adaptability, scalability, and security\u2014are more critical than ever. The database a company chooses will be one of the most strategic decisions determining the success of its AI initiatives. Generative AI applications have already begun delivering productivity gains, writing code, drafting documents, and answering questions. But the real transformation lies ahead with agentic AI \u2014applications that perceive, decide, and act. These intelligent agents don\u2019t just follow workflows; they pursue outcomes, reasoning about the best steps to achieve them. And in that loop, the database is indispensable. It provides the memory that allows agents to perceive context, the facts that allow them to decide intelligently, and the state that will enable them to act coherently. This is why a company\u2019s data is its most valuable asset. Large language models (LLMs) may generate responses, but it is the database that provides continuity, collaboration, and true intelligence. The future of AI is not only about reasoning\u2014it is about context, memory, and the power of your data. The ideal database for transformative AI So what does the ideal database for agentic AI look like? It must reflect today\u2019s complexity and tomorrow\u2019s change. It must speak the language of AI, which is increasingly JSON. It must integrate advanced retrieval across raw data, metadata, and embeddings\u2014not just exact matching but meaning and intent. It must bridge private data and LLMs with the highest-quality embeddings and rerankers. And it must deliver the performance, scalability, and security required to power mission-critical applications at a global scale. This is precisely what MongoDB delivers. We don\u2019t simply check the boxes on this list\u2014we define them. We\u2019re only just getting started That\u2019s why I am so optimistic about our future. The energy and creativity we see at every MongoDB.local event remind me of the passion that has always fueled this company. As our customers continue to innovate, I know MongoDB is in the perfect position to help them succeed in the AI era. We can\u2019t wait to see what you build next.

The start of every new season is a perfect time to consider change and new beginnings. While fall might make you think about pumpkin spice and newly chilly evenings, I\u2019m thinking about the latest round of transformations that MongoDB\u2019s customers are embracing to thrive in an AI-powered world. In all seriousness, legacy systems and technical debt are huge challenges: the cost of tech debt has been estimated at almost $4 trillion dollars. That\u2019s trillion with a T! Legacy systems can slow down innovation, create bottlenecks, and make it tough to deliver the seamless, real-time experiences customers increasingly expect. But companies are finding that modernizing their applications isn't just about fixing what's broken\u2014modernization enables them to move faster and innovate for end-users. That\u2019s why I'm incredibly excited to share the recent launch of MongoDB\u2019s Application Modernization Platform (AMP). This AI-powered program is designed to help enterprises move beyond outdated infrastructures to embrace a flexible, data-driven future. AMP is a comprehensive approach to modernization that combines smart AI tooling with proven methodologies, enabling businesses to transform their applications from the ground up, moving from legacy monoliths to a more flexible, microservices-based architecture. In this roundup, we're spotlighting customers who understand the strategic importance of modernization. You'll see how Wells Fargo is using MongoDB to power a new credit card platform, how CSX is ensuring business continuity during a critical migration, how Intellect Design is modernizing its wealth management platform, and how Deutsche Telekom is transforming its B2C digital channels. With MongoDB, customers are showing how integral a modern database is to powering the next generation of applications\u2014and succeeding in the AI era. Wells Fargo Wells Fargo sought to modernize its mainframe-dependent credit card platform to provide a faster, more seamless customer experience and handle an exponential increase in transaction data. The company's legacy system was costly to manage and lacked the scalability needed for its \"Cards 2.0\" initiative. To solve this, Wells Fargo built an operational data store (ODS) using MongoDB. This new platform allowed them to adopt reusable APIs, streamline integrations, and move from a monolithic architecture to flexible microservices. The ODS now serves 40% of traffic from external vendors, handling more than 7 million transactions with sub-second service. By leveraging MongoDB, Wells Fargo was able to jumpstart its mainframe modernization and create curated data products to serve real-time, personalized financial services. CSX CSX , a major U.S. railroad company, sought to modernize its critical operations platform, RTOP, by migrating it to the cloud. The challenge was to maintain the platform's 24/7 availability with minimal disruption to its mission-critical, near real-time operations during the transition. To solve this, CSX selected MongoDB Atlas on Azure and partnered with MongoDB Professional Services . Leveraging the Cluster-to-Cluster Sync feature, the team was able to facilitate continuous data synchronization and complete the entire migration in just a few hours. The move to MongoDB Atlas has equipped CSX with a more scalable and resilient platform. This modernization effort established a blueprint for migrating other critical applications and helped CSX continue its digital transformation journey toward becoming America\u2019s best-run railroad. Intellect Design Intellect Design , a global fintech company, sought to modernize its wealth management platform to overcome legacy system bottlenecks and multihour batch processing delays. The company's rigid relational database architecture limited its ability to scale and innovate. To solve this, the company partnered with MongoDB, using our AMP methodology and generative AI tools. This transformation reengineered the platform's core components, resulting in an 85% reduction in onboarding workflow times, allowing clients to access critical portfolio insights faster than ever. This initiative is the first step in Intellect Design's long-term vision to integrate its entire application suite into a unified, AI-driven service. By leveraging MongoDB Atlas's flexible schema and powerful native tools, the company is now better positioned to deliver smarter analytics and advanced AI capabilities to its customers.
